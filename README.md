Website Project MAMP/XAMPP Setup Instructions:

1)	Download MAMP/XAMPP and get the corresponding one setup on your computer. 
2)	For Mac OS, you’ll need to change directory into your global hard drive level Applications folder probably like the following:
a.	cd /       (this will change into your global HD directory)
b.	cd Applications
c.	cd MAMP (or whatever the specific instance of MAMP on your machine is)
d.	cd htdocs
e.	I’m not sure of the process for XAMPP, but if memory serves me right it’s similar in the sense that there’s a directory inside of it where you put all content (similar to the htdocs folder) from which you can run these things. 
3)	Once inside of htdocs, go ahead and use the “git clone ______” with the clone link for the repository on GitHub. 
4)	At this point, you should have the whole website downloaded in your MAMP server folder, so when you watch through the video tutorials I gave you, you should be able to at least get that Wordpress installation up and running and see how everything starts to work.

Similarly, you could just set up the GitHub repo elsewhere on your machine and choose to copy it into the current MAMP/XAMPP folder each time you make changes/pull down from GitHub. It’s up to you.

Let me know if you have any trouble/any questions.
